# Pixel DreamWorlds
<p>A landing page for a web3 pixel art game
<p>This project is part of a master's thesis defended with honors in 2023 at AGH University. 
It is a landing page for a web3 pixel art game. Ultimately, on this website, potential players would be able to select preconfiguration parameters for rendering their game world and mint them as an NFT token. 
This token would then serve as the access key and certificate of ownership for their own iteration of the game world.</p>
